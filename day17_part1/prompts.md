"""
You finally decode the Elves' message. HI, the message says. You continue searching for the sleigh keys.

Ahead of you is what appears to be a large ocean trench. Could the keys have fallen into it? You'd better send a probe to investigate.

The probe launcher on your submarine can fire the probe with any integer velocity in the x (forward) and y (upward, or downward if negative) directions. For example, an initial x,y velocity like 0,10 would fire the probe straight up, while an initial velocity like 10,-1 would fire the probe forward at a slight downward angle.

The probe's x,y position starts at 0,0. Then, it will follow some trajectory by moving in steps. On each step, these changes occur in the following order:

The probe's x position increases by its x velocity.
The probe's y position increases by its y velocity.
Due to drag, the probe's x velocity changes by 1 toward the value 0; that is, it decreases by 1 if it is greater than 0, increases by 1 if it is less than 0, or does not change if it is already 0.
Due to gravity, the probe's y velocity decreases by 1.
For the probe to successfully make it into the trench, the probe must be on some trajectory that causes it to be within a target area after any step. The submarine computer has already calculated this target area (your puzzle input). For example:

target area: x=20..30, y=-10..-5
This target area means that you need to find initial x,y velocity values such that after any step, the probe's x position is at least 20 and at most 30, and the probe's y position is at least -10 and at most -5.

Given this target area, one initial velocity that causes the probe to be within the target area after any step is 7,2:

....................TTTTTTTTTTT
....................TTTTTTTTTTT
....................TTTTTTTT#TT
....................TTTTTTTTTTT

....................TTTTTTTTTTT
In this diagram, S is the probe's initial position, 0,0. The x coordinate increases to the right, and the y coordinate increases upward. In the bottom right, positions that are within the target area are shown as T. After each step (until the target area is reached), the position of the probe is marked with #. (The bottom-right # is both a position the probe reaches and a position in the target area.)

Another initial velocity that causes the probe to be within the target area after any step is 6,3:

One initial velocity that doesn't cause the probe to be within the target area after any step is 17,-4:
The probe appears to pass through the target area, but is never within it after any step. Instead, it continues down and to the right - only the first few steps are shown.

If you're going to fire a highly scientific probe out of a super cool probe launcher, you might as well do it with style. How high can you make the probe go while still reaching the target area?

In the above example, using an initial velocity of 6,9 is the best you can do, causing the probe to reach a maximum y position of 45. (Any higher initial y velocity causes the probe to overshoot the target area entirely.)

Find the initial velocity that causes the probe to reach the highest y position and still eventually be within the target area after any step. What is the highest y position it reaches on this trajectory?
"""
A:
"""
First, let's break down the problem and create an algorithm to solve it:

Read the input to get the target area.
Iterate through different combinations of x and y velocities.
For each combination of velocities, simulate the probe's trajectory.
Check if the probe's position is within the target area during any step of the trajectory.
If the probe reaches the target area, track the maximum y position reached.
Find the maximum y position across all valid trajectories.
Now let's write the golang program to implement this algorithm:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"bufio"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	file, err := os.Open("day17_part1/test.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	defer file.Close()

	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
	scanner.Scan()
	line := scanner.Text()
	parts := strings.Split(line, ", ")
	xRange := strings.Split(parts[0][2:], "..")
	yRange := strings.Split(parts[1][2:], "..")
	xMin, _ := strconv.Atoi(xRange[0])
	xMax, _ := strconv.Atoi(xRange[1])
	yMin, _ := strconv.Atoi(yRange[0])
	yMax, _ := strconv.Atoi(yRange[1])

	maxY := -1 << 30
	for xVel := -1000; xVel <= 1000; xVel++ {
		for yVel := -1000; yVel <= 1000; yVel++ {
			xPos, yPos := 0, 0
			curXVel, curYVel := xVel, yVel
			highestY := yPos
			for {
				xPos += curXVel
				yPos += curYVel

				if xPos >= xMin && xPos <= xMax && yPos >= yMin && yPos <= yMax {
					if highestY > maxY {
						maxY = highestY
					}
					break
				}

				if curXVel > 0 {
					curXVel--
				} else if curXVel < 0 {
					curXVel++
				}

				curYVel--
				if yPos > highestY {
					highestY = yPos
				}
			}
		}
	}

	fmt.Println("The highest y position the probe reaches:", maxY)
}
```
Save this code in a file named probe.go and make sure the input file day17_part1/test.txt is in the same directory. Then compile and run the program using the

# Prompt 2 - Bing
I have a golang progra that simulate throwing a rock to a target area.
My program simulate the rock's trajectory and check if the rock's position is within the target area during any step of the trajectory. How could I now that my rock miss the target and is going further away I want to have check for that. My target xMin, xMax, yMin, yMax coordinates as integers. My possition is as well xPos, yPos of integers the velocity is as well integers. How could I determent that my rock is going further away from the target area and will not hit it? Could you write me small function for that check in golang?
A:
"""
Sure! Hereâ€™s a simple function in Go that takes the current position and velocity of the rock as well as the target area coordinates and returns true if the rock is moving away from the target area and false otherwise:
```go
func isMovingAway(xPos int, yPos int, xVel int, yVel int, xMin int, xMax int, yMin int, yMax int) bool {
    if xPos < xMin && xVel < 0 {
        return true
    }
    if xPos > xMax && xVel > 0 {
        return true
    }
    if yPos < yMin && yVel < 0 {
        return true
    }
    if yPos > yMax && yVel > 0 {
        return true
    }
    return false
}
```
This function checks if the rock is to the left of the target area and moving left (xPos < xMin && xVel < 0), to the right of the target area and moving right (xPos > xMax && xVel > 0), below the target area and moving down (yPos < yMin && yVel < 0), or above the target area and moving up (yPos > yMax && yVel > 0). If any of these conditions are true, then the rock is moving away from the target area.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
