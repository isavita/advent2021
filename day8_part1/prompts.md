how could I find the index of given string when I search for it in array of strings in go?
A:
"""
In Go, you can search for an element of string type in a given slice of strings with the help of `SearchStrings()` function. This function searches for the given element in a sorted slice of strings and returns the index of that element if present in the given slice¹.

Is there anything else you would like to know?

Could you give me function that does that for not sorted slice? Please, give me and simple example how to use that.
A:
"""
I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any specific function for finding the index of a string in an unsorted slice of strings in Go. However, you could write your own function to do this. Here's an example:

```go
func findIndex(slice []string, value string) int {
    for i, item := range slice {
        if item == value {
            return i
        }
    }
    return -1
}
```

This function takes a slice of strings and the value you're searching for as arguments. It iterates over the slice and returns the index of the first occurrence of the value. If the value is not found, it returns -1.

Is there anything else you would like to know?

Thank you! Could you help me with summarizing for me as simple coding challenge task? I am getting very confused with some part of the requirement because involves some guessing.

Sure! I’d be happy to help. Can you provide me with more details about the coding challenge and which parts you find confusing?

# Prompt 4 - Bing
Here is description of the coding challenge:
"""
As your submarine slowly makes its way through the cave system, you notice that the four-digit seven-segment displays in your submarine are malfunctioning; they must have been damaged during the escape. You'll be in a lot of trouble without them, so you'd better figure out what's wrong.
Each digit of a seven-segment display is rendered by turning on or off any of seven segments named a through g:
  0:      1:      2:      3:      4:
 aaaa    ....    aaaa    aaaa    ....
b    c  .    c  .    c  .    c  b    c
b    c  .    c  .    c  .    c  b    c
 ....    ....    dddd    dddd    dddd
e    f  .    f  e    .  .    f  .    f
e    f  .    f  e    .  .    f  .    f
 gggg    ....    gggg    gggg    ....
....
So, to render a 1, only segments c and f would be turned on; the rest would be off. To render a 7, only segments a, c, and f would be turned on.
The problem is that the signals which control the segments have been mixed up on each display. The submarine is still trying to display numbers by producing output on signal wires a through g, but those wires are connected to segments randomly. Worse, the wire/segment connections are mixed up separately for each four-digit display! (All of the digits within a display use the same connections, though.)
So, you might know that only signal wires b and g are turned on, but that doesn't mean segments b and g are turned on: the only digit that uses two segments is 1, so it must mean segments c and f are meant to be on. With just that information, you still can't tell which wire (b/g) goes to which segment (c/f). For that, you'll need to collect more information.
For each display, you watch the changing signals for a while, make a note of all ten unique signal patterns you see, and then write down a single four digit output value (your puzzle input). Using the signal patterns, you should be able to work out which pattern corresponds to which digit.
For example, here is what you might see in a single entry in your notes:

acedgfb cdfbe gcdfa fbcad dab cefabd cdfgeb eafb cagedb ab |
cdfeb fcadb cdfeb cdbaf
(The entry is wrapped here to two lines so it fits; in your notes, it will all be on a single line.)

Each entry consists of ten unique signal patterns, a | delimiter, and finally the four digit output value. Within an entry, the same wire/segment connections are used (but you don't know what the connections actually are). The unique signal patterns correspond to the ten different ways the submarine tries to render a digit using the current wire/segment connections. Because 7 is the only digit that uses three segments, dab in the above example means that to render a 7, signal lines d, a, and b are on. Because 4 is the only digit that uses four segments, eafb means that to render a 4, signal lines e, a, f, and b are on.

Using this information, you should be able to work out which combination of signal wires corresponds to each of the ten digits. Then, you can decode the four digit output value. Unfortunately, in the above example, all of the digits in the output value (cdfeb fcadb cdfeb cdbaf) use five segments and are more difficult to deduce.
For now, focus on the easy digits. Consider this larger example:
```
be cfbegad cbdgef fgaecd cgeb fdcge agebfd fecdb fabcd edb |
fdgacbe cefdb cefbgd gcbe
edbfga begcd cbg gc gcadebf fbgde acbgfd abcde gfcbed gfec |
fcgedb cgb dgebacf gc
fgaebd cg bdaec gdafb agbcfd gdcbef bgcad gfac gcb cdgabef |
cg cg fdcagb cbg
```
Because the digits 1, 4, 7, and 8 each use a unique number of segments, you should be able to tell which combinations of signals correspond to those digits. Counting only digits in the output values (the part after | on each line), in the above example, there are 26 instances of digits that use a unique number of segments (highlighted above).
"""
A:
"""
From what I understand, the coding challenge involves figuring out the correct mapping between signal wires and segments on a seven-segment display. Each display has its own unique mapping and you need to determine this mapping by observing the changing signals for each display.

Is that correct? Is there anything specific you would like me to explain further?

This part of the challenge describes how the signal wires and segments are mixed up on each display. The submarine is still trying to display numbers by producing output on signal wires a through g, but those wires are connected to segments randomly. This means that even if you know which signal wires are turned on, you can’t tell which segments are turned on without additional information.

To determine the correct mapping between signal wires and segments for each display, you need to observe the changing signals for a while and make a note of all ten unique signal patterns you see. These signal patterns correspond to the ten different ways the submarine tries to render a digit using the current wire/segment connections.

For example, if you see that only signal wires b and g are turned on, it must mean that segments c and f are meant to be on because 1 is the only digit that uses two segments. However, with just this information alone, you still can’t tell which wire (b/g) goes to which segment (c/f). You’ll need to collect more information by observing more signal patterns.

Once you have collected all ten unique signal patterns for a display and written down its four-digit output value (your puzzle input), you should be able to work out which pattern corresponds to which digit.

Does this help clarify things for you?
