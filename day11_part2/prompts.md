Unfortunately, the requirement changed again.
The new requirements are as follows:

--- Part Two ---
It seems like the individual flashes aren't bright enough to navigate. However, you might have a better option: the flashes seem to be synchronizing!

In the example above, the first time all octopuses flash simultaneously is step 195:

If you can calculate the exact moments when the octopuses will all flash simultaneously, you should be able to navigate through the cavern. What is the first step during which all octopuses flash?

A:

Okay, here's a modified version of the previous Go program that solves the new requirements:
```go
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

type octopus struct {
    energy int
    flashed bool
}

func allFlashed(grid [][]octopus) bool {
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < 10; j++ {
            if grid[i][j].energy > 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
    }
    return true
}

func main() {
    // Open the input file
    file, err := os.Open("day11_part1/test.txt")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer file.Close()

    // Read the input file
    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
    grid := make([][]octopus, 10)
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        grid[i] = make([]octopus, 10)
        scanner.Scan()
        line := scanner.Text()
        for j, c := range line {
            grid[i][j].energy = int(c - '0')
        }
    }

    // Simulate steps until all octopuses flash simultaneously
    for step := 1; ; step++ {
        // Increase the energy of each octopus
        for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
            for j := 0; j < 10; j++ {
                grid[i][j].energy++
            }
        }

        // Check which octopuses will flash
        for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
            for j := 0; j < 10; j++ {
                if grid[i][j].energy > 9 && !grid[i][j].flashed {
                    grid[i][j].flashed = true
                    // Increase the energy of adjacent octopuses
                    for ii := i-1; ii <= i+1; ii++ {
                        for jj := j-1; jj <= j+1; jj++ {
                            if ii >= 0 && ii < 10 && jj >= 0 && jj < 10 {
                                grid[ii][jj].energy++
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Reset the energy of flashed octopuses
        for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
            for j := 0; j < 10; j++ {
                if grid[i][j].flashed {
                    grid[i][j].energy = 0
                    grid[i][j].flashed = false
                }
            }
        }

        // Check if all octopuses have flashed
        if allFlashed(grid) {
            // Print the result
            fmt.Println(step)
            break
        }
    }
}
```
This program reads the input from "day11_part1/test.txt" and stores the energy levels of the octopuses in a 10x10 grid. Then, it simulates steps until all octopuses flash simultaneously by increasing the energy of each octopus, checking which octopuses will flash, increasing the energy of adjacent octopuses, resetting the energy of flashed octopuses, and checking if all octopuses have flashed. Finally, it prints the first step during which all octopuses flash and exits the program.
