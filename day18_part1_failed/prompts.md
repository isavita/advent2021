You descend into the ocean trench and encounter some snailfish. They say they saw the sleigh keys! They'll even tell you which direction the keys went if you help one of the smaller snailfish with his math homework.

Snailfish numbers aren't like regular numbers. Instead, every snailfish number is a pair - an ordered list of two elements. Each element of the pair can be either a regular number or another pair.

Pairs are written as [x,y], where x and y are the elements within the pair. Here are some example snailfish numbers, one snailfish number per line:

[1,2]
[[1,2],3]
[9,[8,7]]
[[1,9],[8,5]]
[[[[1,2],[3,4]],[[5,6],[7,8]]],9]
[[[9,[3,8]],[[0,9],6]],[[[3,7],[4,9]],3]]
[[[[1,3],[5,3]],[[1,3],[8,7]]],[[[4,9],[6,9]],[[8,2],[7,3]]]]
This snailfish homework is about addition. To add two snailfish numbers, form a pair from the left and right parameters of the addition operator. For example, [1,2] + [[3,4],5] becomes [[1,2],[[3,4],5]].

There's only one problem: snailfish numbers must always be reduced, and the process of adding two snailfish numbers can result in snailfish numbers that need to be reduced.

To reduce a snailfish number, you must repeatedly do the first action in this list that applies to the snailfish number:

If any pair is nested inside four pairs, the leftmost such pair explodes.
If any regular number is 10 or greater, the leftmost such regular number splits.
Once no action in the above list applies, the snailfish number is reduced.

During reduction, at most one action applies, after which the process returns to the top of the list of actions. For example, if split produces a pair that meets the explode criteria, that pair explodes before other splits occur.

To explode a pair, the pair's left value is added to the first regular number to the left of the exploding pair (if any), and the pair's right value is added to the first regular number to the right of the exploding pair (if any). Exploding pairs will always consist of two regular numbers. Then, the entire exploding pair is replaced with the regular number 0.

Here are some examples of a single explode action:

[[[[[9,8],1],2],3],4] becomes [[[[0,9],2],3],4] (the 9 has no regular number to its left, so it is not added to any regular number).
[7,[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [7,[6,[5,[7,0]]]] (the 2 has no regular number to its right, and so it is not added to any regular number).
[[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]],1] becomes [[6,[5,[7,0]]],3].
[[3,[2,[1,[7,3]]]],[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] (the pair [3,2] is unaffected because the pair [7,3] is further to the left; [3,2] would explode on the next action).
[[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[7,0]]]].
To split a regular number, replace it with a pair; the left element of the pair should be the regular number divided by two and rounded down, while the right element of the pair should be the regular number divided by two and rounded up. For example, 10 becomes [5,5], 11 becomes [5,6], 12 becomes [6,6], and so on.

Here is the process of finding the reduced result of [[[[4,3],4],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]] + [1,1]:

after addition: [[[[[4,3],4],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]],[1,1]]
after explode:  [[[[0,7],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]],[1,1]]
after explode:  [[[[0,7],4],[15,[0,13]]],[1,1]]
after split:    [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[0,13]]],[1,1]]
after split:    [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[0,[6,7]]]],[1,1]]
after explode:  [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]]
Once no reduce actions apply, the snailfish number that remains is the actual result of the addition operation: [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]].

The homework assignment involves adding up a list of snailfish numbers (your puzzle input). The snailfish numbers are each listed on a separate line. Add the first snailfish number and the second, then add that result and the third, then add that result and the fourth, and so on until all numbers in the list have been used once.

For example, the final sum of this list is [[[[1,1],[2,2]],[3,3]],[4,4]]:

[1,1]
[2,2]
[3,3]
[4,4]
The final sum of this list is [[[[3,0],[5,3]],[4,4]],[5,5]]:

[1,1]
[2,2]
[3,3]
[4,4]
[5,5]
The final sum of this list is [[[[5,0],[7,4]],[5,5]],[6,6]]:

[1,1]
[2,2]
[3,3]
[4,4]
[5,5]
[6,6]
Here's a slightly larger example:

[[[0,[4,5]],[0,0]],[[[4,5],[2,6]],[9,5]]]
[7,[[[3,7],[4,3]],[[6,3],[8,8]]]]
[[2,[[0,8],[3,4]]],[[[6,7],1],[7,[1,6]]]]
[[[[2,4],7],[6,[0,5]]],[[[6,8],[2,8]],[[2,1],[4,5]]]]
[7,[5,[[3,8],[1,4]]]]
[[2,[2,2]],[8,[8,1]]]
[2,9]
[1,[[[9,3],9],[[9,0],[0,7]]]]
[[[5,[7,4]],7],1]
[[[[4,2],2],6],[8,7]]
The final sum [[[[8,7],[7,7]],[[8,6],[7,7]]],[[[0,7],[6,6]],[8,7]]] is found after adding up the above snailfish numbers:

  [[[0,[4,5]],[0,0]],[[[4,5],[2,6]],[9,5]]]
+ [7,[[[3,7],[4,3]],[[6,3],[8,8]]]]
= [[[[4,0],[5,4]],[[7,7],[6,0]]],[[8,[7,7]],[[7,9],[5,0]]]]

  [[[[4,0],[5,4]],[[7,7],[6,0]]],[[8,[7,7]],[[7,9],[5,0]]]]
+ [[2,[[0,8],[3,4]]],[[[6,7],1],[7,[1,6]]]]
= [[[[6,7],[6,7]],[[7,7],[0,7]]],[[[8,7],[7,7]],[[8,8],[8,0]]]]
To check whether it's the right answer, the snailfish teacher only checks the magnitude of the final sum. The magnitude of a pair is 3 times the magnitude of its left element plus 2 times the magnitude of its right element. The magnitude of a regular number is just that number.

For example, the magnitude of [9,1] is 3*9 + 2*1 = 29; the magnitude of [1,9] is 3*1 + 2*9 = 21. Magnitude calculations are recursive: the magnitude of [[9,1],[1,9]] is 3*29 + 2*21 = 129.

Here are a few more magnitude examples:
[[1,2],[[3,4],5]] becomes 143.
[[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]] becomes 1384.
So, given this example homework assignment:
The final sum is:
The magnitude of this final sum is 4140.

Add up all of the snailfish numbers from the homework assignment in the order they appear. What is the magnitude of the final sum?

You descend into the ocean trench and encounter some snailfish. They say they saw the sleigh keys! They'll even tell you which direction the keys went if you help one of the smaller snailfish with his math homework.

Snailfish numbers aren't like regular numbers. Instead, every snailfish number is a pair - an ordered list of two elements. Each element of the pair can be either a regular number or another pair.

Pairs are written as [x,y], where x and y are the elements within the pair. Here are some example snailfish numbers, one snailfish number per line:

[1,2]
[[1,2],3]
[9,[8,7]]
[[1,9],[8,5]]
[[[[1,2],[3,4]],[[5,6],[7,8]]],9]
[[[9,[3,8]],[[0,9],6]],[[[3,7],[4,9]],3]]
[[[[1,3],[5,3]],[[1,3],[8,7]]],[[[4,9],[6,9]],[[8,2],[7,3]]]]
This snailfish homework is about addition. To add two snailfish numbers, form a pair from the left and right parameters of the addition operator. For example, [1,2] + [[3,4],5] becomes [[1,2],[[3,4],5]].

There's only one problem: snailfish numbers must always be reduced, and the process of adding two snailfish numbers can result in snailfish numbers that need to be reduced.

To reduce a snailfish number, you must repeatedly do the first action in this list that applies to the snailfish number:

If any pair is nested inside four pairs, the leftmost such pair explodes.
If any regular number is 10 or greater, the leftmost such regular number splits.
Once no action in the above list applies, the snailfish number is reduced.

During reduction, at most one action applies, after which the process returns to the top of the list of actions. For example, if split produces a pair that meets the explode criteria, that pair explodes before other splits occur.

To explode a pair, the pair's left value is added to the first regular number to the left of the exploding pair (if any), and the pair's right value is added to the first regular number to the right of the exploding pair (if any). Exploding pairs will always consist of two regular numbers. Then, the entire exploding pair is replaced with the regular number 0.

Here are some examples of a single explode action:

[[[[[9,8],1],2],3],4] becomes [[[[0,9],2],3],4] (the 9 has no regular number to its left, so it is not added to any regular number).
[7,[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [7,[6,[5,[7,0]]]] (the 2 has no regular number to its right, and so it is not added to any regular number).
[[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]],1] becomes [[6,[5,[7,0]]],3].
[[3,[2,[1,[7,3]]]],[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] (the pair [3,2] is unaffected because the pair [7,3] is further to the left; [3,2] would explode on the next action).
[[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[7,0]]]].
To split a regular number, replace it with a pair; the left element of the pair should be the regular number divided by two and rounded down, while the right element of the pair should be the regular number divided by two and rounded up. For example, 10 becomes [5,5], 11 becomes [5,6], 12 becomes [6,6], and so on.

Here is the process of finding the reduced result of [[[[4,3],4],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]] + [1,1]:

after addition: [[[[[4,3],4],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]],[1,1]]
after explode:  [[[[0,7],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]],[1,1]]
after explode:  [[[[0,7],4],[15,[0,13]]],[1,1]]
after split:    [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[0,13]]],[1,1]]
after split:    [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[0,[6,7]]]],[1,1]]
after explode:  [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]]
Once no reduce actions apply, the snailfish number that remains is the actual result of the addition operation: [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]].

The homework assignment involves adding up a list of snailfish numbers (your puzzle input). The snailfish numbers are each listed on a separate line. Add the first snailfish number and the second, then add that result and the third, then add that result and the fourth, and so on until all numbers in the list have been used once.

For example, the final sum of this list is [[[[1,1],[2,2]],[3,3]],[4,4]]:

[1,1]
[2,2]
[3,3]
[4,4]
The final sum of this list is [[[[3,0],[5,3]],[4,4]],[5,5]]:

[1,1]
[2,2]
[3,3]
[4,4]
[5,5]
The final sum of this list is [[[[5,0],[7,4]],[5,5]],[6,6]]:

[1,1]
[2,2]
[3,3]
[4,4]
[5,5]
[6,6]
Here's a slightly larger example:

[[[0,[4,5]],[0,0]],[[[4,5],[2,6]],[9,5]]]
[7,[[[3,7],[4,3]],[[6,3],[8,8]]]]
[[2,[[0,8],[3,4]]],[[[6,7],1],[7,[1,6]]]]
[[[[2,4],7],[6,[0,5]]],[[[6,8],[2,8]],[[2,1],[4,5]]]]
[7,[5,[[3,8],[1,4]]]]
[[2,[2,2]],[8,[8,1]]]
[2,9]
[1,[[[9,3],9],[[9,0],[0,7]]]]
[[[5,[7,4]],7],1]
[[[[4,2],2],6],[8,7]]
The final sum [[[[8,7],[7,7]],[[8,6],[7,7]]],[[[0,7],[6,6]],[8,7]]] is found after adding up the above snailfish numbers:

  [[[0,[4,5]],[0,0]],[[[4,5],[2,6]],[9,5]]]
+ [7,[[[3,7],[4,3]],[[6,3],[8,8]]]]
= [[[[4,0],[5,4]],[[7,7],[6,0]]],[[8,[7,7]],[[7,9],[5,0]]]]

  [[[[4,0],[5,4]],[[7,7],[6,0]]],[[8,[7,7]],[[7,9],[5,0]]]]
+ [[2,[[0,8],[3,4]]],[[[6,7],1],[7,[1,6]]]]
= [[[[6,7],[6,7]],[[7,7],[0,7]]],[[[8,7],[7,7]],[[8,8],[8,0]]]]
To check whether it's the right answer, the snailfish teacher only checks the magnitude of the final sum. The magnitude of a pair is 3 times the magnitude of its left element plus 2 times the magnitude of its right element. The magnitude of a regular number is just that number.

For example, the magnitude of [9,1] is 3*9 + 2*1 = 29; the magnitude of [1,9] is 3*1 + 2*9 = 21. Magnitude calculations are recursive: the magnitude of [[9,1],[1,9]] is 3*29 + 2*21 = 129.

Here are a few more magnitude examples:
[[1,2],[[3,4],5]] becomes 143.
[[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]] becomes 1384.
So, given this example homework assignment:
The final sum is:
The magnitude of this final sum is 4140.

Add up all of the snailfish numbers from the homework assignment in the order they appear. What is the magnitude of the final sum?

# Prompt 5 - Bing
I have the following string in go "[[1,2],[[3,4],5]]".
I want to split it as follows:
[[1,2],[[3,4],5]] -> ([1,2],[[3,4],5])
[1,2] -> (1,2)
[[3,4],5] -> ([3,4],5)
[3,4] -> (3,4)
[5] -> (5)
Could you write for me function that does that and return interface{}?
something like this one but working
```go
type snailfishNumber interface{} 
func parseSnailfishNumber(s string) snailfishNumber {
	if s == "" {
		return nil
	}
	if s[0] == '[' {
		fmt.Println("1:", s, s[1:len(s)-1])
		innerPairs := strings.SplitN(s[1:len(s)-1], ",", 1)

			parseSnailfishNumber(innerPairs[1]),

Sure! Here’s a function in Go that takes a string as input and returns a slice of integers:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
)

func splitString(s string) []int {
	s = strings.ReplaceAll(s, "[", "")
	s = strings.ReplaceAll(s, "]", "")
	split := strings.Split(s, ",")
	result := make([]int, len(split))
	for i, v := range split {
		num, err := strconv.Atoi(v)
		if err != nil {

		}
		result[i] = num
	}
	return result
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(splitString("[[1,2],[[3,4],5]]"))
}
```
This function first removes all the square brackets from the input string using strings.ReplaceAll. Then it splits the resulting string on commas using strings.Split. Finally it converts each element of the resulting slice to an integer using strconv.Atoi and appends it to a slice of integers.

Is this what you were looking for?

The error you’re seeing occurs because the comma variable is not being set correctly. The strings.Index function returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the given string. In this case, it’s returning the index of the first comma in the string "[1,2],3", which is 2.

However, this is not what you want. You want to find the index of the comma that separates [1,2] and 3. To do this correctly, you need to keep track of nested square brackets and only consider commas that are not inside any square brackets.

however, the functions seems not working correctly.
I am getting 0 for the snail when I execute the code.
The requirement are as follows:
```
To explode a pair, the pair's left value is added to the first regular number to the left of the exploding pair (if any), and the pair's right value is added to the first regular number to the right of the exploding pair (if any). Exploding pairs will always consist of two regular numbers. Then, the entire exploding pair is replaced with the regular number 0.

Here are some examples of a single explode action:

[[[[[9,8],1],2],3],4] becomes [[[[0,9],2],3],4] (the 9 has no regular number to its left, so it is not added to any regular number).
[7,[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [7,[6,[5,[7,0]]]] (the 2 has no regular number to its right, and so it is not added to any regular number).
[[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]],1] becomes [[6,[5,[7,0]]],3].
[[3,[2,[1,[7,3]]]],[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] (the pair [3,2] is unaffected because the pair [7,3] is further to the left; [3,2] would explode on the next action).
[[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[7,0]]]].

"""
You descend into the ocean trench and encounter some snailfish. They say they saw the sleigh keys! They'll even tell you which direction the keys went if you help one of the smaller snailfish with his math homework.

Snailfish numbers aren't like regular numbers. Instead, every snailfish number is a pair - an ordered list of two elements. Each element of the pair can be either a regular number or another pair.

Pairs are written as [x,y], where x and y are the elements within the pair. Here are some example snailfish numbers, one snailfish number per line:

[1,2]
[[1,2],3]
[9,[8,7]]
[[1,9],[8,5]]
[[[[1,2],[3,4]],[[5,6],[7,8]]],9]
[[[9,[3,8]],[[0,9],6]],[[[3,7],[4,9]],3]]
[[[[1,3],[5,3]],[[1,3],[8,7]]],[[[4,9],[6,9]],[[8,2],[7,3]]]]
This snailfish homework is about addition. To add two snailfish numbers, form a pair from the left and right parameters of the addition operator. For example, [1,2] + [[3,4],5] becomes [[1,2],[[3,4],5]].

There's only one problem: snailfish numbers must always be reduced, and the process of adding two snailfish numbers can result in snailfish numbers that need to be reduced.

To reduce a snailfish number, you must repeatedly do the first action in this list that applies to the snailfish number:

If any pair is nested inside four pairs, the leftmost such pair explodes.
If any regular number is 10 or greater, the leftmost such regular number splits.
Once no action in the above list applies, the snailfish number is reduced.

During reduction, at most one action applies, after which the process returns to the top of the list of actions. For example, if split produces a pair that meets the explode criteria, that pair explodes before other splits occur.

To explode a pair, the pair's left value is added to the first regular number to the left of the exploding pair (if any), and the pair's right value is added to the first regular number to the right of the exploding pair (if any). Exploding pairs will always consist of two regular numbers. Then, the entire exploding pair is replaced with the regular number 0.

Here are some examples of a single explode action:

[[[[[9,8],1],2],3],4] becomes [[[[0,9],2],3],4] (the 9 has no regular number to its left, so it is not added to any regular number).
[7,[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [7,[6,[5,[7,0]]]] (the 2 has no regular number to its right, and so it is not added to any regular number).
[[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]],1] becomes [[6,[5,[7,0]]],3].
[[3,[2,[1,[7,3]]]],[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] (the pair [3,2] is unaffected because the pair [7,3] is further to the left; [3,2] would explode on the next action).
[[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[7,0]]]].
To split a regular number, replace it with a pair; the left element of the pair should be the regular number divided by two and rounded down, while the right element of the pair should be the regular number divided by two and rounded up. For example, 10 becomes [5,5], 11 becomes [5,6], 12 becomes [6,6], and so on.

Here is the process of finding the reduced result of [[[[4,3],4],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]] + [1,1]:

after addition: [[[[[4,3],4],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]],[1,1]]
after explode:  [[[[0,7],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]],[1,1]]
after explode:  [[[[0,7],4],[15,[0,13]]],[1,1]]
after split:    [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[0,13]]],[1,1]]
after split:    [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[0,[6,7]]]],[1,1]]
after explode:  [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]]
Once no reduce actions apply, the snailfish number that remains is the actual result of the addition operation: [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]].

The homework assignment involves adding up a list of snailfish numbers (your puzzle input). The snailfish numbers are each listed on a separate line. Add the first snailfish number and the second, then add that result and the third, then add that result and the fourth, and so on until all numbers in the list have been used once.
Here's a slightly larger example:
To check whether it's the right answer, the snailfish teacher only checks the magnitude of the final sum. The magnitude of a pair is 3 times the magnitude of its left element plus 2 times the magnitude of its right element. The magnitude of a regular number is just that number.

For example, the magnitude of [9,1] is 3*9 + 2*1 = 29; the magnitude of [1,9] is 3*1 + 2*9 = 21. Magnitude calculations are recursive: the magnitude of [[9,1],[1,9]] is 3*29 + 2*21 = 129.

Here are a few more magnitude examples:
[[1,2],[[3,4],5]] becomes 143.
[[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]] becomes 1384.
So, given this example homework assignment:
The final sum is:
The magnitude of this final sum is 4140.

Add up all of the snailfish numbers from the homework assignment in the order they appear. What is the magnitude of the final sum?

Then, it initializes the sum with the first snailfish number and iterates through the rest of the numbers, adding them to the sum. Finally, it prints the magnitude of the final sum.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. The issue occurs because we cannot directly compare interface types in Go using the == operator. To fix this, we need to implement a custom function to compare the equality of the snailfish numbers.

```go
func isEqual(a, b interface{}) bool {

# Prompt 7 - GPT4
I think the magitude function is not working correctly.
Here is the task explanation for it
"""
To check whether it's the right answer, the snailfish teacher only checks the magnitude of the final sum. The magnitude of a pair is 3 times the magnitude of its left element plus 2 times the magnitude of its right element. The magnitude of a regular number is just that number.

For example, the magnitude of [9,1] is 3*9 + 2*1 = 29; the magnitude of [1,9] is 3*1 + 2*9 = 21. Magnitude calculations are recursive: the magnitude of [[9,1],[1,9]] is 3*29 + 2*21 = 129.

Here are a few more magnitude examples:

[[1,2],[[3,4],5]] becomes 143.
[[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]] becomes 1384.
[[[[1,1],[2,2]],[3,3]],[4,4]] becomes 445.
[[[[3,0],[5,3]],[4,4]],[5,5]] becomes 791.
[[[[5,0],[7,4]],[5,5]],[6,6]] becomes 1137.
[[[[8,7],[7,7]],[[8,6],[7,7]]],[[[0,7],[6,6]],[8,7]]] becomes 3488.
So, given this example homework assignment:

[[[0,[5,8]],[[1,7],[9,6]]],[[4,[1,2]],[[1,4],2]]]
[[[5,[2,8]],4],[5,[[9,9],0]]]
[6,[[[6,2],[5,6]],[[7,6],[4,7]]]]
[[[6,[0,7]],[0,9]],[4,[9,[9,0]]]]
[[[7,[6,4]],[3,[1,3]]],[[[5,5],1],9]]
[[6,[[7,3],[3,2]]],[[[3,8],[5,7]],4]]
[[[[5,4],[7,7]],8],[[8,3],8]]
[[9,3],[[9,9],[6,[4,9]]]]
[[2,[[7,7],7]],[[5,8],[[9,3],[0,2]]]]
[[[[5,2],5],[8,[3,7]]],[[5,[7,5]],[4,4]]]
The final sum is:

[[[[6,6],[7,6]],[[7,7],[7,0]]],[[[7,7],[7,7]],[[7,8],[9,9]]]]
The magnitude of this final sum is 4140.

I apologize for the oversight. I misunderstood the task's explanation of the magnitude function. Here is the corrected version of the magnitude function:

You descend into the ocean trench and encounter some snailfish. They say they saw the sleigh keys! They'll even tell you which direction the keys went if you help one of the smaller snailfish with his math homework.

Snailfish numbers aren't like regular numbers. Instead, every snailfish number is a pair - an ordered list of two elements. Each element of the pair can be either a regular number or another pair.

Pairs are written as [x,y], where x and y are the elements within the pair. Here are some example snailfish numbers, one snailfish number per line:

[1,2]
[[1,2],3]
[9,[8,7]]
[[1,9],[8,5]]
[[[[1,2],[3,4]],[[5,6],[7,8]]],9]
[[[9,[3,8]],[[0,9],6]],[[[3,7],[4,9]],3]]
[[[[1,3],[5,3]],[[1,3],[8,7]]],[[[4,9],[6,9]],[[8,2],[7,3]]]]
This snailfish homework is about addition. To add two snailfish numbers, form a pair from the left and right parameters of the addition operator. For example, [1,2] + [[3,4],5] becomes [[1,2],[[3,4],5]].

There's only one problem: snailfish numbers must always be reduced, and the process of adding two snailfish numbers can result in snailfish numbers that need to be reduced.

To reduce a snailfish number, you must repeatedly do the first action in this list that applies to the snailfish number:

If any pair is nested inside four pairs, the leftmost such pair explodes.
If any regular number is 10 or greater, the leftmost such regular number splits.
Once no action in the above list applies, the snailfish number is reduced.

During reduction, at most one action applies, after which the process returns to the top of the list of actions. For example, if split produces a pair that meets the explode criteria, that pair explodes before other splits occur.

To explode a pair, the pair's left value is added to the first regular number to the left of the exploding pair (if any), and the pair's right value is added to the first regular number to the right of the exploding pair (if any). Exploding pairs will always consist of two regular numbers. Then, the entire exploding pair is replaced with the regular number 0.

Here are some examples of a single explode action:

[[[[[9,8],1],2],3],4] becomes [[[[0,9],2],3],4] (the 9 has no regular number to its left, so it is not added to any regular number).
[7,[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [7,[6,[5,[7,0]]]] (the 2 has no regular number to its right, and so it is not added to any regular number).
[[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]],1] becomes [[6,[5,[7,0]]],3].
[[3,[2,[1,[7,3]]]],[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] (the pair [3,2] is unaffected because the pair [7,3] is further to the left; [3,2] would explode on the next action).
[[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[7,0]]]].
To split a regular number, replace it with a pair; the left element of the pair should be the regular number divided by two and rounded down, while the right element of the pair should be the regular number divided by two and rounded up. For example, 10 becomes [5,5], 11 becomes [5,6], 12 becomes [6,6], and so on.

Here is the process of finding the reduced result of [[[[4,3],4],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]] + [1,1]:

after addition: [[[[[4,3],4],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]],[1,1]]
after explode: [[[[0,7],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]],[1,1]]
after explode: [[[[0,7],4],[15,[0,13]]],[1,1]]
after split: [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[0,13]]],[1,1]]
after split: [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[0,[6,7]]]],[1,1]]
after explode: [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]]
Once no reduce actions apply, the snailfish number that remains is the actual result of the addition operation: [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]].

The homework assignment involves adding up a list of snailfish numbers (your puzzle input). The snailfish numbers are each listed on a separate line. Add the first snailfish number and the second, then add that result and the third, then add that result and the fourth, and so on until all numbers in the list have been used once.
Here's a slightly larger example:
To check whether it's the right answer, the snailfish teacher only checks the magnitude of the final sum. The magnitude of a pair is 3 times the magnitude of its left element plus 2 times the magnitude of its right element. The magnitude of a regular number is just that number.

For example, the magnitude of [9,1] is 39 + 21 = 29; the magnitude of [1,9] is 31 + 29 = 21. Magnitude calculations are recursive: the magnitude of [[9,1],[1,9]] is 329 + 221 = 129.

Pairs are written as [x,y], where x and y are the elements within the pair. Here are some example snailfish numbers, one snailfish number per line:

[1,2]
[[1,2],3]
[9,[8,7]]
[[1,9],[8,5]]
[[[[1,2],[3,4]],[[5,6],[7,8]]],9]
[[[9,[3,8]],[[0,9],6]],[[[3,7],[4,9]],3]]
[[[[1,3],[5,3]],[[1,3],[8,7]]],[[[4,9],[6,9]],[[8,2],[7,3]]]]
This snailfish homework is about addition. To add two snailfish numbers, form a pair from the left and right parameters of the addition operator. For example, [1,2] + [[3,4],5] becomes [[1,2],[[3,4],5]].

There's only one problem: snailfish numbers must always be reduced, and the process of adding two snailfish numbers can result in snailfish numbers that need to be reduced.

To reduce a snailfish number, you must repeatedly do the first action in this list that applies to the snailfish number:

If any pair is nested inside four pairs, the leftmost such pair explodes.
If any regular number is 10 or greater, the leftmost such regular number splits.
Once no action in the above list applies, the snailfish number is reduced.

During reduction, at most one action applies, after which the process returns to the top of the list of actions. For example, if split produces a pair that meets the explode criteria, that pair explodes before other splits occur.

To explode a pair, the pair's left value is added to the first regular number to the left of the exploding pair (if any), and the pair's right value is added to the first regular number to the right of the exploding pair (if any). Exploding pairs will always consist of two regular numbers. Then, the entire exploding pair is replaced with the regular number 0.

Here are some examples of a single explode action:

[[[[[9,8],1],2],3],4] becomes [[[[0,9],2],3],4] (the 9 has no regular number to its left, so it is not added to any regular number).
[7,[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [7,[6,[5,[7,0]]]] (the 2 has no regular number to its right, and so it is not added to any regular number).
[[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]],1] becomes [[6,[5,[7,0]]],3].
[[3,[2,[1,[7,3]]]],[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] (the pair [3,2] is unaffected because the pair [7,3] is further to the left; [3,2] would explode on the next action).
[[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[7,0]]]].
To split a regular number, replace it with a pair; the left element of the pair should be the regular number divided by two and rounded down, while the right element of the pair should be the regular number divided by two and rounded up. For example, 10 becomes [5,5], 11 becomes [5,6], 12 becomes [6,6], and so on.

Here is the process of finding the reduced result of [[[[4,3],4],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]] + [1,1]:

after addition: [[[[[4,3],4],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]],[1,1]]
after explode:  [[[[0,7],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]],[1,1]]
after explode:  [[[[0,7],4],[15,[0,13]]],[1,1]]
after split:    [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[0,13]]],[1,1]]
after split:    [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[0,[6,7]]]],[1,1]]
after explode:  [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]]
Once no reduce actions apply, the snailfish number that remains is the actual result of the addition operation: [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]].

The homework assignment involves adding up a list of snailfish numbers (your puzzle input). The snailfish numbers are each listed on a separate line. Add the first snailfish number and the second, then add that result and the third, then add that result and the fourth, and so on until all numbers in the list have been used once.

For example, the final sum of this list is [[[[1,1],[2,2]],[3,3]],[4,4]]:

[1,1]
[2,2]
[3,3]
[4,4]
The final sum of this list is [[[[3,0],[5,3]],[4,4]],[5,5]]:

[1,1]
[2,2]
[3,3]
[4,4]
[5,5]
The final sum of this list is [[[[5,0],[7,4]],[5,5]],[6,6]]:

[1,1]
[2,2]
[3,3]
[4,4]
[5,5]
[6,6]
Here's a slightly larger example:

[[[0,[4,5]],[0,0]],[[[4,5],[2,6]],[9,5]]]
[7,[[[3,7],[4,3]],[[6,3],[8,8]]]]
[[2,[[0,8],[3,4]]],[[[6,7],1],[7,[1,6]]]]
[[[[2,4],7],[6,[0,5]]],[[[6,8],[2,8]],[[2,1],[4,5]]]]
[7,[5,[[3,8],[1,4]]]]
[[2,[2,2]],[8,[8,1]]]
[2,9]
[1,[[[9,3],9],[[9,0],[0,7]]]]
[[[5,[7,4]],7],1]
[[[[4,2],2],6],[8,7]]
The final sum [[[[8,7],[7,7]],[[8,6],[7,7]]],[[[0,7],[6,6]],[8,7]]] is found after adding up the above snailfish numbers:

  [[[0,[4,5]],[0,0]],[[[4,5],[2,6]],[9,5]]]
+ [7,[[[3,7],[4,3]],[[6,3],[8,8]]]]
= [[[[4,0],[5,4]],[[7,7],[6,0]]],[[8,[7,7]],[[7,9],[5,0]]]]

  [[[[4,0],[5,4]],[[7,7],[6,0]]],[[8,[7,7]],[[7,9],[5,0]]]]
+ [[2,[[0,8],[3,4]]],[[[6,7],1],[7,[1,6]]]]
= [[[[6,7],[6,7]],[[7,7],[0,7]]],[[[8,7],[7,7]],[[8,8],[8,0]]]]

  [[[[6,7],[6,7]],[[7,7],[0,7]]],[[[8,7],[7,7]],[[8,8],[8,0]]]]
+ [[[[2,4],7],[6,[0,5]]],[[[6,8],[2,8]],[[2,1],[4,5]]]]
= [[[[7,0],[7,7]],[[7,7],[7,8]]],[[[7,7],[8,8]],[[7,7],[8,7]]]]

  [[[[7,0],[7,7]],[[7,7],[7,8]]],[[[7,7],[8,8]],[[7,7],[8,7]]]]
+ [7,[5,[[3,8],[1,4]]]]
= [[[[7,7],[7,8]],[[9,5],[8,7]]],[[[6,8],[0,8]],[[9,9],[9,0]]]]

  [[[[7,7],[7,8]],[[9,5],[8,7]]],[[[6,8],[0,8]],[[9,9],[9,0]]]]
+ [[2,[2,2]],[8,[8,1]]]
= [[[[6,6],[6,6]],[[6,0],[6,7]]],[[[7,7],[8,9]],[8,[8,1]]]]

  [[[[6,6],[6,6]],[[6,0],[6,7]]],[[[7,7],[8,9]],[8,[8,1]]]]
+ [2,9]
= [[[[6,6],[7,7]],[[0,7],[7,7]]],[[[5,5],[5,6]],9]]

  [[[[6,6],[7,7]],[[0,7],[7,7]]],[[[5,5],[5,6]],9]]
+ [1,[[[9,3],9],[[9,0],[0,7]]]]
= [[[[7,8],[6,7]],[[6,8],[0,8]]],[[[7,7],[5,0]],[[5,5],[5,6]]]]

  [[[[7,8],[6,7]],[[6,8],[0,8]]],[[[7,7],[5,0]],[[5,5],[5,6]]]]
+ [[[5,[7,4]],7],1]
= [[[[7,7],[7,7]],[[8,7],[8,7]]],[[[7,0],[7,7]],9]]

  [[[[7,7],[7,7]],[[8,7],[8,7]]],[[[7,0],[7,7]],9]]
+ [[[[4,2],2],6],[8,7]]
= [[[[8,7],[7,7]],[[8,6],[7,7]]],[[[0,7],[6,6]],[8,7]]]
To check whether it's the right answer, the snailfish teacher only checks the magnitude of the final sum. The magnitude of a pair is 3 times the magnitude of its left element plus 2 times the magnitude of its right element. The magnitude of a regular number is just that number.

For example, the magnitude of [9,1] is 3*9 + 2*1 = 29; the magnitude of [1,9] is 3*1 + 2*9 = 21. Magnitude calculations are recursive: the magnitude of [[9,1],[1,9]] is 3*29 + 2*21 = 129.

Here are a few more magnitude examples:

[[1,2],[[3,4],5]] becomes 143.
[[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]] becomes 1384.
[[[[1,1],[2,2]],[3,3]],[4,4]] becomes 445.
[[[[3,0],[5,3]],[4,4]],[5,5]] becomes 791.
[[[[5,0],[7,4]],[5,5]],[6,6]] becomes 1137.
[[[[8,7],[7,7]],[[8,6],[7,7]]],[[[0,7],[6,6]],[8,7]]] becomes 3488.
So, given this example homework assignment:

[[[0,[5,8]],[[1,7],[9,6]]],[[4,[1,2]],[[1,4],2]]]
[[[5,[2,8]],4],[5,[[9,9],0]]]
[6,[[[6,2],[5,6]],[[7,6],[4,7]]]]
[[[6,[0,7]],[0,9]],[4,[9,[9,0]]]]
[[[7,[6,4]],[3,[1,3]]],[[[5,5],1],9]]
[[6,[[7,3],[3,2]]],[[[3,8],[5,7]],4]]
[[[[5,4],[7,7]],8],[[8,3],8]]
[[9,3],[[9,9],[6,[4,9]]]]
[[2,[[7,7],7]],[[5,8],[[9,3],[0,2]]]]
[[[[5,2],5],[8,[3,7]]],[[5,[7,5]],[4,4]]]
The final sum is:

[[[[6,6],[7,6]],[[7,7],[7,0]]],[[[7,7],[7,7]],[[7,8],[9,9]]]]
The magnitude of this final sum is 4140.

You descend into the ocean trench and encounter some snailfish. They say they saw the sleigh keys! They'll even tell you which direction the keys went if you help one of the smaller snailfish with his math homework.

Snailfish numbers aren't like regular numbers. Instead, every snailfish number is a pair - an ordered list of two elements. Each element of the pair can be either a regular number or another pair.

Pairs are written as [x,y], where x and y are the elements within the pair. Here are some example snailfish numbers, one snailfish number per line:

[1,2]
[[1,2],3]
[9,[8,7]]
[[1,9],[8,5]]
[[[[1,2],[3,4]],[[5,6],[7,8]]],9]
[[[9,[3,8]],[[0,9],6]],[[[3,7],[4,9]],3]]
[[[[1,3],[5,3]],[[1,3],[8,7]]],[[[4,9],[6,9]],[[8,2],[7,3]]]]
This snailfish homework is about addition. To add two snailfish numbers, form a pair from the left and right parameters of the addition operator. For example, [1,2] + [[3,4],5] becomes [[1,2],[[3,4],5]].

There's only one problem: snailfish numbers must always be reduced, and the process of adding two snailfish numbers can result in snailfish numbers that need to be reduced.

To reduce a snailfish number, you must repeatedly do the first action in this list that applies to the snailfish number:

If any pair is nested inside four pairs, the leftmost such pair explodes.
If any regular number is 10 or greater, the leftmost such regular number splits.
Once no action in the above list applies, the snailfish number is reduced.

During reduction, at most one action applies, after which the process returns to the top of the list of actions. For example, if split produces a pair that meets the explode criteria, that pair explodes before other splits occur.

To explode a pair, the pair's left value is added to the first regular number to the left of the exploding pair (if any), and the pair's right value is added to the first regular number to the right of the exploding pair (if any). Exploding pairs will always consist of two regular numbers. Then, the entire exploding pair is replaced with the regular number 0.

Here are some examples of a single explode action:

[[[[[9,8],1],2],3],4] becomes [[[[0,9],2],3],4] (the 9 has no regular number to its left, so it is not added to any regular number).
[7,[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [7,[6,[5,[7,0]]]] (the 2 has no regular number to its right, and so it is not added to any regular number).
[[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]],1] becomes [[6,[5,[7,0]]],3].
[[3,[2,[1,[7,3]]]],[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] (the pair [3,2] is unaffected because the pair [7,3] is further to the left; [3,2] would explode on the next action).
[[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[4,[3,2]]]]] becomes [[3,[2,[8,0]]],[9,[5,[7,0]]]].
To split a regular number, replace it with a pair; the left element of the pair should be the regular number divided by two and rounded down, while the right element of the pair should be the regular number divided by two and rounded up. For example, 10 becomes [5,5], 11 becomes [5,6], 12 becomes [6,6], and so on.

Here is the process of finding the reduced result of [[[[4,3],4],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]] + [1,1]:

after addition: [[[[[4,3],4],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]],[1,1]]
after explode:  [[[[0,7],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]],[1,1]]
after explode:  [[[[0,7],4],[15,[0,13]]],[1,1]]
after split:    [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[0,13]]],[1,1]]
after split:    [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[0,[6,7]]]],[1,1]]
after explode:  [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]]
Once no reduce actions apply, the snailfish number that remains is the actual result of the addition operation: [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]].

The homework assignment involves adding up a list of snailfish numbers (your puzzle input). The snailfish numbers are each listed on a separate line. Add the first snailfish number and the second, then add that result and the third, then add that result and the fourth, and so on until all numbers in the list have been used once.

For example, the final sum of this list is [[[[1,1],[2,2]],[3,3]],[4,4]]:

[1,1]
[2,2]
[3,3]
[4,4]
The final sum of this list is [[[[3,0],[5,3]],[4,4]],[5,5]]:

The final sum [[[[8,7],[7,7]],[[8,6],[7,7]]],[[[0,7],[6,6]],[8,7]]] is found after adding up the above snailfish numbers:

  [[[0,[4,5]],[0,0]],[[[4,5],[2,6]],[9,5]]]

+ [[[[4,2],2],6],[8,7]]
= [[[[8,7],[7,7]],[[8,6],[7,7]]],[[[0,7],[6,6]],[8,7]]]
To check whether it's the right answer, the snailfish teacher only checks the magnitude of the final sum. The magnitude of a pair is 3 times the magnitude of its left element plus 2 times the magnitude of its right element. The magnitude of a regular number is just that number.

For example, the magnitude of [9,1] is 3*9 + 2*1 = 29; the magnitude of [1,9] is 3*1 + 2*9 = 21. Magnitude calculations are recursive: the magnitude of [[9,1],[1,9]] is 3*29 + 2*21 = 129.

Here are a few more magnitude examples:

[[1,2],[[3,4],5]] becomes 143.
[[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]] becomes 1384.
[[[[1,1],[2,2]],[3,3]],[4,4]] becomes 445.
[[[[3,0],[5,3]],[4,4]],[5,5]] becomes 791.
[[[[5,0],[7,4]],[5,5]],[6,6]] becomes 1137.
[[[[8,7],[7,7]],[[8,6],[7,7]]],[[[0,7],[6,6]],[8,7]]] becomes 3488.
So, given this example homework assignment:

[[[0,[5,8]],[[1,7],[9,6]]],[[4,[1,2]],[[1,4],2]]]
[[[5,[2,8]],4],[5,[[9,9],0]]]

[[2,[[7,7],7]],[[5,8],[[9,3],[0,2]]]]
[[[[5,2],5],[8,[3,7]]],[[5,[7,5]],[4,4]]]
The final sum is:

Note that the implementation uses eval to parse the input file as a list of nested arrays, which can be a security risk if the input is untrusted. A more secure approach would be to use a JSON or YAML parser to read the input file.
