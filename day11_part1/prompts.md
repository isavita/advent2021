# Prompt 2
Task:
"""
You enter a large cavern full of rare bioluminescent dumbo octopuses! They seem to not like the Christmas lights on your submarine, so you turn them off for now.

There are 100 octopuses arranged neatly in a 10 by 10 grid. Each octopus slowly gains energy over time and flashes brightly for a moment when its energy is full. Although your lights are off, maybe you could navigate through the cave without disturbing the octopuses if you could predict when the flashes of light will happen.

Each octopus has an energy level - your submarine can remotely measure the energy level of each octopus (your puzzle input). For example:

5483143223
2745854711
5264556173
6141336146
6357385478
4167524645
2176841721
6882881134
4846848554
5283751526
The energy level of each octopus is a value between 0 and 9. Here, the top-left octopus has an energy level of 5, the bottom-right one has an energy level of 6, and so on.

You can model the energy levels and flashes of light in steps. During a single step, the following occurs:

First, the energy level of each octopus increases by 1.
Then, any octopus with an energy level greater than 9 flashes. This increases the energy level of all adjacent octopuses by 1, including octopuses that are diagonally adjacent. If this causes an octopus to have an energy level greater than 9, it also flashes. This process continues as long as new octopuses keep having their energy level increased beyond 9. (An octopus can only flash at most once per step.)
Finally, any octopus that flashed during this step has its energy level set to 0, as it used all of its energy to flash.
Adjacent flashes can cause an octopus to flash on a step even if it begins that step with very little energy. Consider the middle octopus with 1 energy in this situation:

Before any steps:
11111
19991
19191
19991
11111

After step 1:
34543
40004
50005
40004
34543

After step 2:
45654
51115
61116
51115
45654
An octopus is highlighted when it flashed during the given step.
After 100 steps, there have been a total of 1656 flashes.
Given the starting energy levels of the dumbo octopuses in your cavern, simulate 100 steps. How many total flashes are there after 100 steps?

Instructions: Write a go program that solves this problem and read the input from "day11_part1/test.txt"
A:
"""
Sure, I can write a Go program to solve this problem and read the input from "day11_part1/test.txt". Let's break down the problem and start thinking about how to solve it.

First, we need to read in the input, which is a 10x10 grid of energy levels for the octopuses. We can read in the input using Go's file I/O capabilities and store it in a 2D slice.

Next, we need to simulate the 100 steps described in the problem statement. During each step, we'll increase the energy level of each octopus by 1, and then check if any octopuses have an energy level greater than 9. If an octopus does have an energy level greater than 9, we'll mark it as flashing and increase the energy level of its adjacent octopuses by 1. We'll continue to do this until no new octopuses have an energy level greater than 9.

Finally, we'll count the total number of flashes that occurred during the simulation and output that number.

Here's the code to solve this problem in Go:

    // Read in the energy levels.
    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
    var energyLevels [][]int
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        scanner.Scan()

            row = append(row, int(c-'0'))

            }
        }

        // Continue to propagate flashes until no new octopuses have an energy level greater than 9.

            newFlashing := map[Point]bool{}

                energyLevels[p.x][p.y] = 0
                for i := p.x - 1; i <= p.x+1; i++ {
                    for j := p.y - 1; j <= p.y+1; j++ {
                        if i >= 0 && i < 10 && j >= 0 && j < 10 {
                            energyLevels[i][j]++
                            if energyLevels[i][j] > 9 {
                                newFlashing[Point{i, j}] = true
                            }

            flashing = newFlashing
        }

        // Count the number of flashes in this step.
        flashes += len(flashing)

    // Output the total number of flashes.
