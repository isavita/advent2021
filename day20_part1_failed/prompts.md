With the scanners fully deployed, you turn their attention to mapping the floor of the ocean trench.

When you get back the image from the scanners, it seems to just be random noise. Perhaps you can combine an image enhancement algorithm and the input image (your puzzle input) to clean it up a little.

For example:

The first section is the image enhancement algorithm. It is normally given on a single line, but it has been wrapped to multiple lines in this example for legibility. The second section is the input image, a two-dimensional grid of light pixels (#) and dark pixels (.).

The image enhancement algorithm describes how to enhance an image by simultaneously converting all pixels in the input image into an output image. Each pixel of the output image is determined by looking at a 3x3 square of pixels centered on the corresponding input image pixel. So, to determine the value of the pixel at (5,10) in the output image, nine pixels from the input image need to be considered: (4,9), (4,10), (4,11), (5,9), (5,10), (5,11), (6,9), (6,10), and (6,11). These nine input pixels are combined into a single binary number that is used as an index in the image enhancement algorithm string.

For example, to determine the output pixel that corresponds to the very middle pixel of the input image, the nine pixels marked by [...] would need to be considered:

# . . # .
#[. . .].
#[# . .]#
.[. # .].
. . # # #
Starting from the top-left and reading across each row, these pixels are ..., then #.., then .#.; combining these forms ...#...#.. By turning dark pixels (.) into 0 and light pixels (#) into 1, the binary number 000100010 can be formed, which is 34 in decimal.

The image enhancement algorithm string is exactly 512 characters long, enough to match every possible 9-bit binary number. The first few characters of the string (numbered starting from zero) are as follows:

0         10        20        30  34    40        50        60        70
|         |         |         |   |     |         |         |         |
..#.#..#####.#.#.#.###.##.....###.##.#..###.####..#####..#....#..#..##..##
In the middle of this first group of characters, the character at index 34 can be found: #. So, the output pixel in the center of the output image should be #, a light pixel.

This process can then be repeated to calculate every pixel of the output image.

Through advances in imaging technology, the images being operated on here are infinite in size. Every pixel of the infinite output image needs to be calculated exactly based on the relevant pixels of the input image. The small input image you have is only a small region of the actual infinite input image; the rest of the input image consists of dark pixels (.). For the purposes of the example, to save on space, only a portion of the infinite-sized input and output images will be shown.

The starting input image, therefore, looks something like this, with more dark pixels (.) extending forever in every direction not shown here:

.....##.##.....
....#..#.#.....
....##.#..#....
....####..#....
.....#..##.....
......##..#....

Through further advances in imaging technology, the above output image can also be used as an input image! This allows it to be enhanced a second time:

Truly incredible - now the small details are really starting to come through. After enhancing the original input image twice, 35 pixels are lit.

Start with the original input image and apply the image enhancement algorithm twice, being careful to account for the infinite size of the images. How many pixels are lit in the resulting image?
"""
NOTE: You have to take in account that the image is infinite and we need to fill missing pixels when we check the algorithm and lit some new pixels, also keep in consideration that the algorithm string is always of length of 512. Please extend the image to be able to have all lit pixels after each iteration.

I want to understand the logic behind this line `index |= 1 << uint(8-(dy+1)*3-(dx+1))` and how it works.
A:
"""
The line index |= 1 << uint(8-(dy+1)*3-(dx+1)) is a bitwise operation that sets a bit in the index variable based on the value of the pixel at the current position and its surrounding pixels.

The function takes an image as input and applies an algorithm to it. The algorithm is represented as a string of 512 characters (2^9 possible combinations of 3x3 pixels). The function loops over each pixel in the image and creates an index based on the values of the surrounding pixels. The index is then used to look up a character in the algorithm string which is used to set the value of the corresponding pixel in the new image.

The index variable is initialized to 0 and each bit in it represents a pixel in the 3x3 grid around the current pixel. The bits are set based on whether or not the corresponding pixel is black ('#'). The bits are set from left to right, top to bottom, with the top-left bit being the most significant bit.

The expression 1 << uint(8-(dy+1)*3-(dx+1)) creates a mask with a single bit set at the position corresponding to the current pixel. The mask is then ORed with index to set the corresponding bit in index.

For example, if we have an image like this:

.#.
###
.#.
The bits in index would be set like this:

000
111
010
And if we had an algorithm like this:

"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:',.<>/?~"
The value of algorithm[index] would be determined by looking up the character at index 7 (binary 000111010 = decimal 58) which is '2'.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.ðŸ™‚

In the middle of this first group of characters, the character at index 34 can be found: #. So, the output pixel in the center of the output image should be #, a light pixel.

This process can then be repeated to calculate every pixel of the output image.

Through advances in imaging technology, the images being operated on here are infinite in size. Every pixel of the infinite output image needs to be calculated exactly based on the relevant pixels of the input image. The small input image you have is only a small region of the actual infinite input image; the rest of the input image consists of dark pixels (.). For the purposes of the example, to save on space, only a portion of the infinite-sized input and output images will be shown.

The starting input image, therefore, looks something like this, with more dark pixels (.) extending forever in every direction not shown here:

...............
...............
...............
...............
...............
.....#..#......
.....#.........
.....##..#.....
.......#.......
.......###.....
...............
...............
...............
...............

By applying the image enhancement algorithm to every pixel simultaneously, the following output image can be obtained:

...............
...............
...............
...............
.....##.##.....
....#..#.#.....
....##.#..#....
....####..#....
.....#..##.....
......##..#....
.......#.#.....
...............
...............
...............
...............
Through further advances in imaging technology, the above output image can also be used as an input image! This allows it to be enhanced a second time:

...............
...............
...............
..........#....
....#..#.#.....
...#.#...###...
...#...##.#....
...#.....#.#...
....#.#####....
.....#.#####...

Truly incredible - now the small details are really starting to come through. After enhancing the original input image twice, 35 pixels are lit.

Start with the original input image and apply the image enhancement algorithm twice, being careful to account for the infinite size of the images. How many pixels are lit in the resulting image?
"""
NOTE: You have to take in account that the image is infinite and we need to fill missing pixels when we check the algorithm and lit some new pixels, also keep in consideration that the algorithm string is always of length of 512. Please extend the image to be able to have all lit pixels after each iteration. Please  take in account when the consider pixel is at the corners of the image to pad the missing values from all 4 sides with '.' but doing it with the 2D image before to start applying the algorithm, by wrapping it in ..... frame?

To solve this task, you can follow these steps:

Read the input from the file.
Separate the algorithm string and input image.
Pad the input image with a frame of '.' characters to account for infinite size.
Apply the image enhancement algorithm twice.
Count the number of lit pixels in the final image.
Here is a sample golang program to solve this task:

```go
package main

	"io/ioutil"

func padImage(image []string) []string {
	width := len(image[0]) + 2

	paddedImage[0] = strings.Repeat(".", width)
	paddedImage[len(paddedImage)-1] = strings.Repeat(".", width)

	for i, row := range image {
		paddedImage[i+1] = "." + row + "."
	}

	return paddedImage
}

func applyAlgorithm(image []string, algorithm string) []string {
	newImage := make([]string, len(image))

	for y := 1; y < len(image)-1; y++ {
		var newRow strings.Builder

				for dx := -1; dx <= 1; dx++ {
					index = index * 2
					if image[y+dy][x+dx] == '#' {
						index++
					}
				}
			}
			newRow.WriteByte(algorithm[index])
		}
		newImage[y] = newRow.String()
	}

	return newImage
}

func countLitPixels(image []string) int {
	count := 0
	for _, row := range image {
		for _, ch := range row {
			if ch == '#' {
				count++
			}
		}
	}
	return count
}

func main() {
	data, err := ioutil.ReadFile("day20_part1/test.txt")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	input := strings.Split(strings.TrimSpace(string(data)), "\n\n")
	algorithm := strings.ReplaceAll(input[0], "\n", "")
	image := strings.Split(input[1], "\n")

	paddedImage := padImage(image)

	for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
		paddedImage = applyAlgorithm(paddedImage, algorithm)
	}

	litPixels := countLitPixels(paddedImage)
	fmt.Println("Lit pixels after applying the algorithm twice:", litPixels)
}
```
This program reads the input from the file, separates the algorithm string and input image, pads the image with a frame of '.' characters, applies the algorithm twice, and counts the lit pixels in the final image.

The issue in your code is in this part:

index := 0
for dy := -1; dy <= 1; dy++ {
    for dx := -1; dx <= 1; dx++ {
        if x+dx >= 0 && x+dx < len(image[0]) && y+dy >= 0 && y+dy < len(image) && image[y+dy][x+dx] == '#' {
            index |= 1 << uint(8-(dy+1)*3-(dx+1))
        }
    }
}
```
You are setting the bits in the index variable from the most significant bit to the least significant bit, but the algorithm string has its values arranged in the reverse order, i.e., from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.

To fix the issue, change the index calculation as follows:

```go
index := 0
for dy := -1; dy <= 1; dy++ {
    for dx := -1; dx <= 1; dx++ {
        if x+dx >= 0 && x+dx < len(image[0]) && y+dy >= 0 && y+dy < len(image) && image[y+dy][x+dx] == '#' {
            index |= 1 << uint((dy+1)*3 + (dx+1))
        }
    }
}
```
This should give you the correct output for the given input file.
