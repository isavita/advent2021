# Prompt 1 - GPT-4
You are a prominent competitive programmer. You have been invited to participate in a programming competition. You are given a task to solve. Do you understand your role?
A:
As an AI language model, I'm not actually a competitive programmer, but I can certainly help you understand and solve programming problems. My role would be to support and guide you through the process, providing insights and suggestions on how to tackle the given task.

As for the likelihood of solving the task, it would depend on several factors such as the complexity of the problem, the time constraints, and the resources available. Given my training on a wide range of programming topics and algorithms, I believe I can be a valuable resource in helping you solve the task. However, the actual implementation and coding would still be up to you.
# Prompt 2 - GPT-3.5
**Instructions:** Write a golang program that solves the task and read the input from "day25_part1/test.txt".
**Task:**
"Sea cucumbers? Yeah, they're probably hunting for food. But don't worry, they're predictable critters: they move in perfectly straight lines, only moving forward when there's space to do so. They're actually quite polite!"

You explain that you'd like to predict when you could land your submarine.

"Oh that's easy, they'll eventually pile up and leave enough space for-- wait, did you say submarine? And the only place with that many sea cucumbers would be at the very bottom of the Mariana--" You hang up the phone.

There are two herds of sea cucumbers sharing the same region; one always moves east (>), while the other always moves south (v). Each location can contain at most one sea cucumber; the remaining locations are empty (.). The submarine helpfully generates a map of the situation (your puzzle input). For example:

v...>>.vv>
.vv>>.vv..
>>.>v>...v
>>v>>.>.v.
v>v.vv.v..
>.>>..v...
.vv..>.>v.
v.v..>>v.v
....v..v.>
Every step, the sea cucumbers in the east-facing herd attempt to move forward one location, then the sea cucumbers in the south-facing herd attempt to move forward one location. When a herd moves forward, every sea cucumber in the herd first simultaneously considers whether there is a sea cucumber in the adjacent location it's facing (even another sea cucumber facing the same direction), and then every sea cucumber facing an empty location simultaneously moves into that location.

So, in a situation like this:

...>>>>>...
After one step, only the rightmost sea cucumber would have moved:

...>>>>.>..
After the next step, two sea cucumbers move:

...>>>.>.>.
During a single step, the east-facing herd moves first, then the south-facing herd moves. So, given this situation:

..........
.>v....v..
.......>..
..........
After a single step, of the sea cucumbers on the left, only the south-facing sea cucumber has moved (as it wasn't out of the way in time for the east-facing cucumber on the left to move), but both sea cucumbers on the right have moved (as the east-facing sea cucumber moved out of the way of the south-facing sea cucumber):

..........
.>........
..v....v>.
..........
Due to strong water currents in the area, sea cucumbers that move off the right edge of the map appear on the left edge, and sea cucumbers that move off the bottom edge of the map appear on the top edge. Sea cucumbers always check whether their destination location is empty before moving, even if that destination is on the opposite side of the map:

Initial state:
...>...
.......
......>
v.....>
......>
.......
..vvv..

After 1 step:
..vv>..
.......
>......
v.....>
>......
.......
....v..

After 2 steps:
....v>.
..vv...
.>.....
......>
v>.....
.......
.......

After 3 steps:
......>
..v.v..
..>v...
>......
..>....
v......
.......

After 4 steps:
>......
..v....
..>.v..
.>.v...
...>...
.......
v......
To find a safe place to land your submarine, the sea cucumbers need to stop moving. Again consider the first example
In this example, the sea cucumbers stop moving after 58 steps.

Find somewhere safe to land your submarine. What is the first step on which no sea cucumbers move?

As instructed, we will read the input from "day25_part1/test.txt". We will represent the input as a two-dimensional slice of bytes, where each byte will represent the content of a cell in the grid. Then, we will simulate the movement of the sea cucumbers as described in the prompt until they stop moving, and we will output the number of steps it took for them to stop.

This program reads in the input from the file day25_part1/test.txt, simulates the movement of the sea cucumbers using the simulate function, and prints out the number of steps it took for the sea cucumbers to stop moving.

Could you fix it?
A:
"""
The error message suggests that the get method is being called on an empty grid, which means that the readInput function may not have read in the input correctly. One reason why this could happen is if the input file has an empty line at the end. To fix this, you can add a check to skip over any empty lines in the input:

```go
func readInput(filename string) Grid {
	b, err := ioutil.ReadFile(filename)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	lines := strings.Split(string(b), "\n")
	var g Grid
	for _, line := range lines {
		if len(line) > 0 {
			g = append(g, []byte(line))
		}
	}
	return g
}
```
This modified readInput function skips over any empty lines in the input file, and should prevent the get method from being called on an empty grid.
