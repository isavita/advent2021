--- Part Two ---
After reviewing the available paths, you realize you might have time to visit a single small cave twice. Specifically, big caves can be visited any number of times, a single small cave can be visited at most twice, and the remaining small caves can be visited at most once. However, the caves named start and end can only be visited exactly once each: once you leave the start cave, you may not return to it, and once you reach the end cave, the path must end immediately.

Now, the 36 possible paths through the first example above are:

start,A,b,A,b,A,c,A,end

"""
With your submarine's subterranean subsystems subsisting suboptimally, the only way you're getting out of this cave anytime soon is by finding a path yourself. Not just a path - the only way to know if you've found the best path is to find all of them.

Fortunately, the sensors are still mostly working, and so you build a rough map of the remaining caves (your puzzle input). For example:

start-A
start-b
A-c
A-b
b-d
A-end
b-end
This is a list of how all of the caves are connected. You start in the cave named start, and your destination is the cave named end. An entry like b-d means that cave b is connected to cave d - that is, you can move between them.

So, the above cave system looks roughly like this:

    start
    /   \
c--A-----b--d
    \   /
     end
Your goal is to find the number of distinct paths that start at start, end at end, and don't visit small caves more than once. There are two types of caves: big caves (written in uppercase, like A) and small caves (written in lowercase, like b). It would be a waste of time to visit any small cave more than once, but big caves are large enough that it might be worth visiting them multiple times. So, all paths you find should visit small caves at most once, and can visit big caves any number of times.

Given these rules, there are 10 paths through this example cave system:

start,A,b,A,c,A,end
start,A,b,A,end
start,A,b,end
start,A,c,A,b,A,end
start,A,c,A,b,end
start,A,c,A,end
start,A,end
start,b,A,c,A,end
start,b,A,end
start,b,end
(Each line in the above list corresponds to a single path; the caves visited by that path are listed in the order they are visited and separated by commas.)

Note that in this cave system, cave d is never visited by any path: to do so, cave b would need to be visited twice (once on the way to cave d and a second time when returning from cave d), and since cave b is small, this is not allowed.

Here is a slightly larger example:

dc-end
HN-start
start-kj
dc-start
dc-HN
LN-dc
HN-end
kj-sa
kj-HN
kj-dc
The 19 paths through it are as follows:

start,HN,dc,HN,end
start,HN,dc,HN,kj,HN,end
start,HN,dc,end
start,HN,dc,kj,HN,end
start,HN,end
start,HN,kj,HN,dc,HN,end
start,HN,kj,HN,dc,end
start,HN,kj,HN,end
start,HN,kj,dc,HN,end
start,HN,kj,dc,end

start,dc,end
start,dc,kj,HN,end
start,kj,HN,dc,HN,end
start,kj,HN,dc,end
start,kj,HN,end
start,kj,dc,HN,end
start,kj,dc,end
Finally, this even larger example has 226 paths through it:

fs-end
he-DX
fs-he
start-DX
pj-DX
end-zg
zg-sl
zg-pj
pj-he
RW-he

Your puzzle answer was 4011.

Now, the function checks for the "end" node first and returns 1 if it is reached, before checking for other connections. This should fix the issue, and you should get the expected output of 103 for the given test case.

I apologize for the confusion. I made a mistake in the program. The node "end" should not be visited more than once, so we need to add a condition to check for this case. Please find the corrected program below:
```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strings"
)

func findPaths(caveMap map[string][]string, visited map[string]int, node string) int {
	if node == "end" {
		return 1
	}

	connections, ok := caveMap[node]
	if !ok {
		return 0
	}

	count := 0
	for _, nextNode := range connections {
		uppercase := strings.ToUpper(nextNode) == nextNode
		_, visitedBefore := visited[nextNode]

		if (uppercase || (!visitedBefore && nextNode != "start") || visited[nextNode] < 2) && (nextNode != "end" || visited[nextNode] == 0) {
			visited[nextNode]++
			count += findPaths(caveMap, visited, nextNode)
			visited[nextNode]--
		}
	}
	return count
}

func main() {
	file, err := os.Open("day12_part2/test.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	defer file.Close()

	caveMap := make(map[string][]string)
	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
	for scanner.Scan() {
		connection := strings.Split(scanner.Text(), "-")
		from, to := connection[0], connection[1]
		caveMap[from] = append(caveMap[from], to)
	}

	visited := make(map[string]int)
	pathsCount := findPaths(caveMap, visited, "start")
	fmt.Println("Paths Count:", pathsCount)
}
```
I added an additional condition in the if statement inside the loop, which checks whether the next node is "end" and ensures that it is not visited more than once. Please try running this modified program, and it should give the expected output.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems there is an issue with the logic in the findPaths function. I will modify the code and fix the problem. Here's the updated version of the Go program:
```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strings"
)

func isBigCave(cave string) bool {
	return strings.ToUpper(cave) == cave
}

func findPaths(caveMap map[string][]string, visited map[string]int, node string) int {
	connections, ok := caveMap[node]
	if !ok {
		return 0
	}

	if node == "end" {
		return 1
	}

	count := 0
	for _, nextNode := range connections {
		uppercase := isBigCave(nextNode)
		visitCount, visitedBefore := visited[nextNode]

		if uppercase || (!visitedBefore && nextNode != "start") || visitCount < 2 {
			visited[nextNode]++
			count += findPaths(caveMap, visited, nextNode)
			visited[nextNode]--
		}
	}
	return count
}

func main() {
	file, err := os.Open("day12_part2/test.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	defer file.Close()

	caveMap := make(map[string][]string)
	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
	for scanner.Scan() {
		connection := strings.Split(scanner.Text(), "-")
		from, to := connection[0], connection[1]
		caveMap[from] = append(caveMap[from], to)
	}

	visited := make(map[string]int)
	pathsCount := findPaths(caveMap, visited, "start")
	fmt.Println("Paths Count:", pathsCount)
}
```
The main difference is that I have added the isBigCave function to check if a cave is a big cave. I have also modified the condition inside the findPaths function. Now, it checks whether the node is uppercase (big cave) or not visited before or the visit count is less than 2.

Please try running this updated version of the Go program and let me know if it provides the expected output.

Context: You are a prominent competitive programmer. You have been invited to participate in a programming competition. You are given a problem to solve.

Task:
"""
With your submarine's subterranean subsystems subsisting suboptimally, the only way you're getting out of this cave anytime soon is by finding a path yourself. Not just a path - the only way to know if you've found the best path is to find all of them.

Fortunately, the sensors are still mostly working, and so you build a rough map of the remaining caves (your puzzle input). For example:

start-A
start-b
A-c
A-b
b-d
A-end
b-end
This is a list of how all of the caves are connected. You start in the cave named start, and your destination is the cave named end. An entry like b-d means that cave b is connected to cave d - that is, you can move between them.

So, the above cave system looks roughly like this:

    start
    /   \
c--A-----b--d
    \   /
     end
Your goal is to find the number of distinct paths that start at start, end at end, and don't visit small caves more than once. There are two types of caves: big caves (written in uppercase, like A) and small caves (written in lowercase, like b). It would be a waste of time to visit any small cave more than once, but big caves are large enough that it might be worth visiting them multiple times. So, all paths you find should visit small caves at most once, and can visit big caves any number of times.

Given these rules, there are 10 paths through this example cave system:

start,A,b,A,c,A,end
start,A,b,A,end
start,A,b,end
start,A,c,A,b,A,end
start,A,c,A,b,end
start,A,c,A,end
start,A,end
start,b,A,c,A,end
start,b,A,end
start,b,end
(Each line in the above list corresponds to a single path; the caves visited by that path are listed in the order they are visited and separated by commas.)

Note that in this cave system, cave d is never visited by any path: to do so, cave b would need to be visited twice (once on the way to cave d and a second time when returning from cave d), and since cave b is small, this is not allowed.

Here is a slightly larger example:

dc-end
HN-start
start-kj
dc-start
dc-HN
LN-dc
HN-end
kj-sa
kj-HN
kj-dc
The 19 paths through it are as follows:

start,HN,dc,HN,end
start,HN,dc,HN,kj,HN,end
start,HN,dc,end
start,HN,dc,kj,HN,end
start,HN,end
start,HN,kj,HN,dc,HN,end
start,HN,kj,HN,dc,end
start,HN,kj,HN,end
start,HN,kj,dc,HN,end
start,HN,kj,dc,end
start,dc,HN,end
start,dc,HN,kj,HN,end
start,dc,end
start,dc,kj,HN,end
start,kj,HN,dc,HN,end
start,kj,HN,dc,end
start,kj,HN,end
start,kj,dc,HN,end
start,kj,dc,end
Finally, this even larger example has 226 paths through it:

fs-end
he-DX
fs-he
start-DX
pj-DX
end-zg
zg-sl
zg-pj
pj-he
RW-he
fs-DX
pj-RW
zg-RW
start-pj
he-WI
zg-he
pj-fs
start-RW

Instructrions: Thank you! The program works as expected. However, there is new task that build on the first task. Read the input for the second task from "day12_part2/test.txt"
Task:
"""
--- Part Two ---
After reviewing the available paths, you realize you might have time to visit a single small cave twice. Specifically, big caves can be visited any number of times, a single small cave can be visited at most twice, and the remaining small caves can be visited at most once. However, the caves named start and end can only be visited exactly once each: once you leave the start cave, you may not return to it, and once you reach the end cave, the path must end immediately.

Now, the 36 possible paths through the first example above are:

start,A,b,A,b,A,c,A,end
start,A,b,A,b,A,end
start,A,b,A,b,end
start,A,b,A,c,A,b,A,end
start,A,b,A,c,A,b,end
start,A,b,A,c,A,c,A,end
start,A,b,A,c,A,end
start,A,b,A,end
start,A,b,d,b,A,c,A,end
start,A,b,d,b,A,end
start,A,b,d,b,end
start,A,b,end
start,A,c,A,b,A,b,A,end
start,A,c,A,b,A,b,end
start,A,c,A,b,A,c,A,end
start,A,c,A,b,A,end
start,A,c,A,b,d,b,A,end
start,A,c,A,b,d,b,end
start,A,c,A,b,end
start,A,c,A,c,A,b,A,end
start,A,c,A,c,A,b,end
start,A,c,A,c,A,end
start,A,c,A,end
start,A,end
start,b,A,b,A,c,A,end
start,b,A,b,A,end
start,b,A,b,end
start,b,A,c,A,b,A,end
start,b,A,c,A,b,end
start,b,A,c,A,c,A,end
start,b,A,c,A,end
start,b,A,end
start,b,d,b,A,c,A,end
start,b,d,b,A,end
start,b,d,b,end
start,b,end
The slightly larger example above now has 103 paths through it, and the even larger example now has 3509 paths through it.
