# Prompt 1
Context: You are a prominent competitive programmer. You have been invited to participate in a programming competition. You are given a problem to solve.
Instructions: Write a go program that solves this problem and read the input from "day7_part1/input.txt"
Task: 
"""
A giant whale has decided your submarine is its next meal, and it's much faster than you are. There's nowhere to run!

Suddenly, a swarm of crabs (each in its own tiny submarine - it's too deep for them otherwise) zooms in to rescue you! They seem to be preparing to blast a hole in the ocean floor; sensors indicate a massive underground cave system just beyond where they're aiming!

The crab submarines all need to be aligned before they'll have enough power to blast a large enough hole for your submarine to get through. However, it doesn't look like they'll be aligned before the whale catches you! Maybe you can help?

There's one major catch - crab submarines can only move horizontally.

You quickly make a list of the horizontal position of each crab (your puzzle input). Crab submarines have limited fuel, so you need to find a way to make all of their horizontal positions match while requiring them to spend as little fuel as possible.

For example, consider the following horizontal positions:

16,1,2,0,4,2,7,1,2,14
This means there's a crab with horizontal position 16, a crab with horizontal position 1, and so on.

Each change of 1 step in horizontal position of a single crab costs 1 fuel. You could choose any horizontal position to align them all on, but the one that costs the least fuel is horizontal position 2:

Move from 16 to 2: 14 fuel
Move from 1 to 2: 1 fuel
Move from 2 to 2: 0 fuel
Move from 0 to 2: 2 fuel
Move from 4 to 2: 2 fuel
Move from 2 to 2: 0 fuel
Move from 7 to 2: 5 fuel
Move from 1 to 2: 1 fuel
Move from 2 to 2: 0 fuel
Move from 14 to 2: 12 fuel
This costs a total of 37 fuel. This is the cheapest possible outcome; more expensive outcomes include aligning at position 1 (41 fuel), position 3 (39 fuel), or position 10 (71 fuel).

Determine the horizontal position that the crabs can align to using the least fuel possible. How much fuel must they spend to align to that position?

Here's a Go program to solve the problem:
```go
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "sort"
    "strconv"
)

func main() {
    file, err := os.Open("day7_part1/input.txt")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer file.Close()

    var positions []int

    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
    for scanner.Scan() {
        position, err := strconv.Atoi(scanner.Text())
        if err != nil {
            panic(err)
        }
        positions = append(positions, position)
    }

    if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    sort.Ints(positions)

    minFuel := -1
    var minPos int

    for i := 0; i < len(positions); i++ {
        pos := positions[i]
        fuel := 0
        for j := 0; j < len(positions); j++ {
            fuel += abs(positions[j] - pos)
        }
        if minFuel == -1 || fuel < minFuel {
            minFuel = fuel
            minPos = pos
        }
    }

    fmt.Printf("The crabs should align at position %d with a total fuel cost of %d.\n", minPos, minFuel)
}

func abs(x int) int {
    if x < 0 {
        return -x
    }
    return x
}
```
The program first reads the input file and stores the crab positions in a slice. It then sorts the slice so that we can try each position in increasing order.

For each position, the program calculates the total fuel cost of aligning all the crabs to that position by iterating through the slice and summing up the absolute differences between each crab's position and the chosen position. If this fuel cost is less than the minimum fuel cost seen so far, we update the minimum fuel cost and the position at which it occurs.

Finally, the program prints the position and the minimum fuel cost.

# Prompt 2 - Bing
How to read complete content of a file in go? Could you give me example?
A:
"""
Sure! Hereâ€™s an example of how to read the complete content of a file in Go:
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
)

func main() {
    data, err := ioutil.ReadFile("filename.txt")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error reading file:", err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Println(string(data))
}
```
This code uses the ioutil.ReadFile function to read the entire contents of a file into memory. The ReadFile function returns a byte slice containing the data and an error value. If the error value is not nil, it means that there was an error reading the file.

Is there anything else you would like to know?
