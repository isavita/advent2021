# Prompt 1
Context: You are a prominent competitive programmer. You have been invited to participate in a programming competition. You are given a problem to solve.
Instructions: Write a go program that solves this problem and read the input from "day7_part1/input.txt"
Task: 
"""
A giant whale has decided your submarine is its next meal, and it's much faster than you are. There's nowhere to run!

Suddenly, a swarm of crabs (each in its own tiny submarine - it's too deep for them otherwise) zooms in to rescue you! They seem to be preparing to blast a hole in the ocean floor; sensors indicate a massive underground cave system just beyond where they're aiming!

The crab submarines all need to be aligned before they'll have enough power to blast a large enough hole for your submarine to get through. However, it doesn't look like they'll be aligned before the whale catches you! Maybe you can help?

There's one major catch - crab submarines can only move horizontally.

You quickly make a list of the horizontal position of each crab (your puzzle input). Crab submarines have limited fuel, so you need to find a way to make all of their horizontal positions match while requiring them to spend as little fuel as possible.

For example, consider the following horizontal positions:

16,1,2,0,4,2,7,1,2,14
This means there's a crab with horizontal position 16, a crab with horizontal position 1, and so on.

Each change of 1 step in horizontal position of a single crab costs 1 fuel. You could choose any horizontal position to align them all on, but the one that costs the least fuel is horizontal position 2:

Move from 16 to 2: 14 fuel
Move from 1 to 2: 1 fuel
Move from 2 to 2: 0 fuel
Move from 0 to 2: 2 fuel
Move from 4 to 2: 2 fuel
Move from 2 to 2: 0 fuel
Move from 7 to 2: 5 fuel
Move from 1 to 2: 1 fuel
Move from 2 to 2: 0 fuel
Move from 14 to 2: 12 fuel
This costs a total of 37 fuel. This is the cheapest possible outcome; more expensive outcomes include aligning at position 1 (41 fuel), position 3 (39 fuel), or position 10 (71 fuel).

Determine the horizontal position that the crabs can align to using the least fuel possible. How much fuel must they spend to align to that position?

}

func abs(x int) int {
	if x < 0 {
		return -x
	}
	return x
}
```
The program first reads the input file and stores the crab positions in a slice. It then sorts the slice so that we can try each position in increasing order.

For each position, the program calculates the total fuel cost of aligning all the crabs to that position by iterating through the slice and summing up the absolute differences between each crab's position and the chosen position. If this fuel cost is less than the minimum fuel cost seen so far, we update the minimum fuel cost and the position at which it occurs.

Finally, the program prints the position and the minimum fuel cost.

Instructions: Write a new program that is base on the first program and read the input from "day7_part2/input.txt". The new program should solve the modified problem.
Task2: 
"""
--- Part Two ---
The crabs don't seem interested in your proposed solution. Perhaps you misunderstand crab engineering?

As it turns out, crab submarine engines don't burn fuel at a constant rate. Instead, each change of 1 step in horizontal position costs 1 more unit of fuel than the last: the first step costs 1, the second step costs 2, the third step costs 3, and so on.

As each crab moves, moving further becomes more expensive. This changes the best horizontal position to align them all on; in the example above, this becomes 5:

Move from 16 to 5: 66 fuel
Move from 1 to 5: 10 fuel
Move from 2 to 5: 6 fuel
Move from 0 to 5: 15 fuel
Move from 4 to 5: 1 fuel
Move from 2 to 5: 6 fuel
Move from 7 to 5: 3 fuel
Move from 1 to 5: 10 fuel
Move from 2 to 5: 6 fuel
Move from 14 to 5: 45 fuel
This costs a total of 168 fuel. This is the new cheapest possible outcome; the old alignment position (2) now costs 206 fuel instead.

Determine the horizontal position that the crabs can align to using the least fuel possible so they can make you an escape route! How much fuel must they spend to align to that position?

Here's the modified Go program that solves the second part of the problem:

func abs(x int) int {

    return x
}
```
The main difference from the first program is that we now calculate the fuel cost for each crab's movement based on the distance they need to move and the step number. Specifically, each step now costs j + 1 units of fuel, where j is the index of the crab in the sorted list of positions. This means that the first step costs 1 unit of fuel, the second step costs 2 units, and so on.

We then calculate the total fuel cost by summing up the fuel costs for each crab's movement to the chosen position. If the total fuel cost is less than the minimum fuel cost seen so far, we update the minimum fuel cost and the position at which it occurs.

Finally, the program prints the position and the minimum fuel cost.

This task is asking you to find the best horizontal position for a group of crabs to align to using the least amount of fuel possible. The crabs’ submarine engines don’t burn fuel at a constant rate. Instead, each change of 1 step in horizontal position costs 1 more unit of fuel than the last. For example, the first step costs 1 unit of fuel, the second step costs 2 units of fuel, and so on.

The task provides an example where the best horizontal position for the crabs to align to is 5. This alignment would cost a total of 168 units of fuel.

Your goal is to determine the horizontal position that would result in the least amount of fuel being used by all crabs combined. You also need to calculate how much fuel must be spent for all crabs to align at that position.

Is there anything else you would like me to explain?

}
```
The program follows a similar approach to the previous one but takes into account the fact that each step costs more fuel than the previous one. To calculate the fuel cost of aligning all the crabs to a given position, the program iterates through the slice of positions and calculates the fuel cost of moving each crab to the chosen position. The fuel cost of moving a crab to the chosen position is given by the sum of the first N natural numbers, where N is the absolute difference between the crab's position and the chosen position. This formula comes from the fact that the cost of each step is the same as the number of steps taken so far.

Finally, the program prints the position and the minimum fuel cost.
