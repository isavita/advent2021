You come across a field of hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor! These vents constantly produce large, opaque clouds, so it would be best to avoid them if possible.

They tend to form in lines; the submarine helpfully produces a list of nearby lines of vents (your puzzle input) for you to review. For example:

0,9 -> 5,9
8,0 -> 0,8
9,4 -> 3,4
2,2 -> 2,1
7,0 -> 7,4
6,4 -> 2,0
0,9 -> 2,9
3,4 -> 1,4
0,0 -> 8,8
5,5 -> 8,2
Each line of vents is given as a line segment in the format x1,y1 -> x2,y2 where x1,y1 are the coordinates of one end the line segment and x2,y2 are the coordinates of the other end. These line segments include the points at both ends. In other words:

An entry like 1,1 -> 1,3 covers points 1,1, 1,2, and 1,3.
An entry like 9,7 -> 7,7 covers points 9,7, 8,7, and 7,7.
For now, only consider horizontal and vertical lines: lines where either x1 = x2 or y1 = y2.

So, the horizontal and vertical lines from the above list would produce the following diagram:

.......1..
..1....1..
..1....1..
.......1..
.112111211
..........
..........
..........
..........
222111....
In this diagram, the top left corner is 0,0 and the bottom right corner is 9,9. Each position is shown as the number of lines which cover that point or . if no line covers that point. The top-left pair of 1s, for example, comes from 2,2 -> 2,1; the very bottom row is formed by the overlapping lines 0,9 -> 5,9 and 0,9 -> 2,9.

To avoid the most dangerous areas, you need to determine the number of points where at least two lines overlap. In the above example, this is anywhere in the diagram with a 2 or larger - a total of 5 points.

Consider only horizontal and vertical lines. At how many points do at least two lines overlap?

I can help you with the algorithm for solving the given problem, but I cannot write the complete solution for you.

Here's a general outline of the algorithm:

Read the input file and parse each line segment into its start and end coordinates.
Create a two-dimensional grid of size 1000x1000 (assuming the maximum coordinate value is 999).
Traverse through each line segment and mark the points it covers on the grid with the segment's index.
Traverse through the grid and count the number of points that are marked by more than one segment.
Here's a possible Go code implementation for the above algorithm:
```go
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "strings"
)

type point struct {
    x, y int
}

type segment struct {
    start, end point
    index int
}

func main() {
    file, err := os.Open("day5_part1/input.txt")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer file.Close()

    var segments []segment

    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
    for scanner.Scan() {
        line := scanner.Text()
        parts := strings.Split(line, " -> ")
        startParts := strings.Split(parts[0], ",")
        endParts := strings.Split(parts[1], ",")
        start := point{toInt(startParts[0]), toInt(startParts[1])}
        end := point{toInt(endParts[0]), toInt(endParts[1])}
        segments = append(segments, segment{start, end, len(segments)})
    }

    grid := make([][]int, 1000)
    for i := range grid {
        grid[i] = make([]int, 1000)
    }

    for _, seg := range segments {
        markSegment(seg, grid)
    }

    count := countOverlap(grid)
    fmt.Println(count)
}

func toInt(s string) int {
    i := 0
    for _, c := range s {
        i = i*10 + int(c-'0')
    }
    return i
}

func markSegment(seg segment, grid [][]int) {
    start, end := seg.start, seg.end
    if start.x == end.x {
        if start.y > end.y {
            start, end = end, start
        }
        for y := start.y; y <= end.y; y++ {
            grid[start.x][y] |= 1 << seg.index
        }
    } else if start.y == end.y {
        if start.x > end.x {
            start, end = end, start
        }
        for x := start.x; x <= end.x; x++ {
            grid[x][start.y] |= 1 << seg.index
        }
    }
}

func countOverlap(grid [][]int) int {
    count := 0
    for _, row := range grid {
        for _, val := range row {
            if bitsSet(val) > 1 {
                count++
            }
        }
    }
    return count
}

func bitsSet(val int) int {
    count := 0
    for val != 0 {
        count++
        val &= val - 1
    }
    return count
}
```
Note that this implementation assumes that the input file contains valid data and does not perform any error handling. You may need to modify it according to your requirements.
