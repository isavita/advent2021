# Prompt 1 - Bing
I have a working go program, but the requirement for the program changed. I needed to parse input that was encoding in a specific way a digit on seven-segment displays and it had problem with the displays. How ever because the task was to count how many 1, 4, 7, 8 they were in the input. I was able to do base on the size of the string for example knowing that value with length of 7 would be "8" and value with length of 2 would be "1". I was able to do it. Could you help me to adjust my program in a way to might the new requirement?

# Prompt 3 - Bing
The new requirement are as follow
"""
Through a little deduction, you should now be able to determine the remaining digits. Consider again the first example above:
acedgfb cdfbe gcdfa fbcad dab cefabd cdfgeb eafb cagedb ab |
cdfeb fcadb cdfeb cdbaf
After some careful analysis, the mapping between signal wires and segments only make sense in the following configuration:
 dddd
e    a
e    a
 ffff
g    b
g    b
 cccc
So, the unique signal patterns would correspond to the following digits:
acedgfb: 8
cdfbe: 5
gcdfa: 2
fbcad: 3
dab: 7
cefabd: 9
cdfgeb: 6
eafb: 4
cagedb: 0
ab: 1
Then, the four digits of the output value can be decoded:

cdfeb: 5
fcadb: 3
cdfeb: 5
cdbaf: 3
Therefore, the output value for this entry is 5353.
Following this same process for each entry in the second, larger example above, the output value of each entry can be determined:

fdgacbe cefdb cefbgd gcbe: 8394
fcgedb cgb dgebacf gc: 9781
cg cg fdcagb cbg: 1197
efabcd cedba gadfec cb: 9361
gecf egdcabf bgf bfgea: 4873
gebdcfa ecba ca fadegcb: 8418
cefg dcbef fcge gbcadfe: 4548
ed bcgafe cdgba cbgef: 1625
gbdfcae bgc cg cgb: 8717
fgae cfgab fg bagce: 4315
Adding all of the output values in this larger example produces 61229.
For each entry, determine all of the wire/segment connections and decode the four-digit output values. What do you get if you add up all of the output values?

# Prompt 9 - Bing
Here is more info how could it change.
"""
The problem is that the signals which control the segments have been mixed up on each display. The submarine is still trying to display numbers by producing output on signal wires a through g, but those wires are connected to segments randomly. Worse, the wire/segment connections are mixed up separately for each four-digit display! (All of the digits within a display use the same connections, though.)

So, you might know that only signal wires b and g are turned on, but that doesn't mean segments b and g are turned on: the only digit that uses two segments is 1, so it must mean segments c and f are meant to be on. With just that information, you still can't tell which wire (b/g) goes to which segment (c/f). For that, you'll need to collect more information.

For each display, you watch the changing signals for a while, make a note of all ten unique signal patterns you see, and then write down a single four digit output value (your puzzle input). Using the signal patterns, you should be able to work out which pattern corresponds to which digit.

For example, here is what you might see in a single entry in your notes:

acedgfb cdfbe gcdfa fbcad dab cefabd cdfgeb eafb cagedb ab |
cdfeb fcadb cdfeb cdbaf
(The entry is wrapped here to two lines so it fits; in your notes, it will all be on a single line.)

Each entry consists of ten unique signal patterns, a | delimiter, and finally the four digit output value. Within an entry, the same wire/segment connections are used (but you don't know what the connections actually are). The unique signal patterns correspond to the ten different ways the submarine tries to render a digit using the current wire/segment connections. Because 7 is the only digit that uses three segments, dab in the above example means that to render a 7, signal lines d, a, and b are on. Because 4 is the only digit that uses four segments, eafb means that to render a 4, signal lines e, a, f, and b are on.

Using this information, you should be able to work out which combination of signal wires corresponds to each of the ten digits. Then, you can decode the four digit output value. Unfortunately, in the above example, all of the digits in the output value (cdfeb fcadb cdfeb cdbaf) use five segments and are more difficult to deduce.

It should solve this problem:
```
Through a little deduction, you should now be able to determine the remaining digits. Consider again the first example above:

acedgfb cdfbe gcdfa fbcad dab cefabd cdfgeb eafb cagedb ab |
cdfeb fcadb cdfeb cdbaf
After some careful analysis, the mapping between signal wires and segments only make sense in the following configuration:

 dddd
e    a
e    a
 ffff
g    b
g    b
 cccc
So, the unique signal patterns would correspond to the following digits:

acedgfb: 8
cdfbe: 5
gcdfa: 2
fbcad: 3
dab: 7
cefabd: 9
cdfgeb: 6
eafb: 4
cagedb: 0
ab: 1
Then, the four digits of the output value can be decoded:

cdfeb: 5
fcadb: 3
cdfeb: 5
cdbaf: 3
Therefore, the output value for this entry is 5353.

Following this same process for each entry in the second, larger example above, the output value of each entry can be determined:

fdgacbe cefdb cefbgd gcbe: 8394
fcgedb cgb dgebacf gc: 9781
cg cg fdcagb cbg: 1197
efabcd cedba gadfec cb: 9361
gecf egdcabf bgf bfgea: 4873
gebdcfa ecba ca fadegcb: 8418
cefg dcbef fcge gbcadfe: 4548
ed bcgafe cdgba cbgef: 1625
gbdfcae bgc cg cgb: 8717
fgae cfgab fg bagce: 4315
Adding all of the output values in this larger example produces 61229.

For each entry, determine all of the wire/segment connections and decode the four-digit output values. What do you get if you add up all of the output values?

Could you completely rewrite the program to work correctly?
# Prompt 1 - Bing
how could I order string of chars alphabetically in go? could you give me example?
A:
"""
Sure! Here’s an example of how you can sort a string of characters alphabetically in Go:
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sort"
    "strings"
)

func main() {
    str := "example"
    chars := strings.Split(str, "")
    sort.Strings(chars)
    sortedStr := strings.Join(chars, "")
    
    fmt.Println(sortedStr)
}
```
This code splits the string into a slice of characters using strings.Split, sorts the slice using sort.Strings, and then joins the sorted characters back into a string using strings.Join. The result is an alphabetically sorted version of the original string.

Is there anything else you’d like to know?
